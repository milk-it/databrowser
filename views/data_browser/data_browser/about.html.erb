<h2>About Rails DataBrowser</h2>

<p>Rails DataBrowser is a data browser based on the idea of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/databrowse/">Django's Databrowser</a>.</p>
<p>Using Rails DataBrowser you can browse, view, edit and crate data through your model classes. It's not a replacement to your DBMS or to your CMS, it's just a helper for developers and WebMasters to manage data without.</p>
